They provide a view into your game world,\n * and can be positioned, rotated, zoomed and scrolled accordingly.\n *\n * A Camera consists of two elements: The viewport and the scroll values.\n *\n * The viewport is the physical position and size of the Camera within your game. Cameras, by default, are\n * created the same size as your game, but their position and size can be set to anything. This means if you\n * wanted to create a camera that was 320x200 in size, positioned in the bottom-right corner of your game,\n * you'd adjust the viewport to do that (using methods like `setViewport` and `setSize`).\n *\n * If you wish to change where the Camera is looking in your game, then you scroll it. You can do this\n * via the properties `scrollX` and `scrollY` or the method `setScroll`. Scrolling has no impact on the\n * viewport, and changing the viewport has no impact on the scrolling.\n *\n * By default a Camera will render all Game Objects it can see. You can change this using the `ignore` method,\n * allowing you to filter Game Objects out on a per-Camera basis.\n *\n * A Camera also has built-in special effects including Fade, Flash and Camera Shake.\n *\n * @class Camera\n * @extends Phaser.Events.EventEmitter\n * @memberOf Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D\n * @constructor\n * @since 3.0.0\n *\n * @param {number} x - The x position of the Camera, relative to the top-left of the game canvas.\n * @param {number} y - The y position of the Camera, relative to the top-left of the game canvas.\n * @param {number} width - The width of the Camera, in pixels.\n * @param {number} height - The height of the Camera, in pixels.\n */\nvar Camera = new Class({\n\n    Extends: EventEmitter,\n\n    initialize:\n\n    function Camera (x, y, width, height)\n    {\n        EventEmitter.call(this);\n\n        /**\n         * A reference to the Scene this camera belongs to.\n         *\n         * @name Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Camera#scene\n         * @type {Phaser.Scene}\n         * @since 3.0.0\n         */\n        this.scene;\n\n        /**\n         * The Camera ID.

Or extend the Camera class with your own addition code and then add\n * the new Camera in using the `addExisting` method.\n * \n * Cameras provide a view into your game world, and can be positioned, rotated, zoomed and scrolled accordingly.\n *\n * A Camera consists of two elements: The viewport and the scroll values.\n *\n * The viewport is the physical position and size of the Camera within your game. Cameras, by default, are\n * created the same size as your game, but their position and size can be set to anything. This means if you\n * wanted to create a camera that was 320x200 in size, positioned in the bottom-right corner of your game,\n * you'd adjust the viewport to do that (using methods like `setViewport` and `setSize`).\n *\n * If you wish to change where the Camera is looking in your game, then you scroll it. You can do this\n * via the properties `scrollX` and `scrollY` or the method `setScroll`. Scrolling has no impact on the\n * viewport, and changing the viewport has no impact on the scrolling.\n *\n * By default a Camera will render all Game Objects it can see. You can change this using the `ignore` method,\n * allowing you to filter Game Objects out on a per-Camera basis. The Camera Manager can manage up to 31 unique \n * 'Game Object ignore capable' Cameras. Any Cameras beyond 31 that you create will all be given a Camera ID of\n * zero, meaning that they cannot be used for Game Object exclusion. This means if you need your Camera to ignore\n * Game Objects, make sure it's one of the first 31 created.\n *\n * A Camera also has built-in special effects including Fade, Flash, Camera Shake, Pan and Zoom.\n *\n * @class CameraManager\n * @memberOf Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D\n * @constructor\n * @since 3.0.0\n *\n * @param {Phaser.Scene} scene - The Scene that owns the Camera Manager plugin.\n */\nvar CameraManager = new Class({\n\n    initialize:\n\n    function CameraManager (scene)\n    {\n        /**\n         * The Scene that owns the Camera Manager plugin.\n         *\n         * @name Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.CameraManager#scene\n         * @type {Phaser.Scene}\n         * @since 3.0.0\n         */\n        this.scene = scene;\n\n        /**\n         * A reference to the Scene.Systems handler for the Scene that owns the Camera Manager.\n         *\n         * @name Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.CameraManager#systems\n         * @type {Phaser.Scenes.Systems}\n         * @since 3.0.0\n         */\n        this.systems = scene.sys;\n\n        /**\n         * All Cameras created by, or added to, this Camera Manager, will have their `roundPixels`\n         * property set to match this value.

Primitives include forms of geometry, such as\n * Rectangles, Circles, and Polygons. They also include lines, arcs and curves. When you initially create a Graphics\n * object it will be empty.\n *\n * To draw to it you must first specify a line style or fill style (or both), draw shapes using paths, and finally\n * fill or stroke them. For example:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * graphics.lineStyle(5, 0xFF00FF, 1.0);\n * graphics.beginPath();\n * graphics.moveTo(100, 100);\n * graphics.lineTo(200, 200);\n * graphics.closePath();\n * graphics.strokePath();\n * ```\n *\n * There are also many helpful methods that draw and fill/stroke common shapes for you.\n *\n * ```javascript\n * graphics.lineStyle(5, 0xFF00FF, 1.0);\n * graphics.fillStyle(0xFFFFFF, 1.0);\n * graphics.fillRect(50, 50, 400, 200);\n * graphics.strokeRect(50, 50, 400, 200);\n * ```\n *\n * When a Graphics object is rendered it will render differently based on if the game is running under Canvas or WebGL.\n * Under Canvas it will use the HTML Canvas context drawing operations to draw the path.\n * Under WebGL the graphics data is decomposed into polygons. Both of these are expensive processes, especially with\n * complex shapes.\n *\n * If your Graphics object doesn't change much (or at all) once you've drawn your shape to it, then you will help\n * performance by calling {@link Phaser.GameObjects.Graphics#generateTexture}. This will 'bake' the Graphics object into\n * a Texture, and return it. You can then use this Texture for Sprites or other display objects. If your Graphics object\n * updates frequently then you should avoid doing this, as it will constantly generate new textures, which will consume\n * memory.\n *\n * As you can tell, Graphics objects are a bit of a trade-off. While they are extremely useful, you need to be careful\n * in their complexity and quantity of them in your game.\n *\n * @class Graphics\n * @extends Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject\n * @memberOf Phaser.GameObjects\n * @constructor\n * @since 3.0.0\n *\n * @extends Phaser.GameObjects.Components.Alpha\n * @extends Phaser.GameObjects.Components.BlendMode\n * @extends Phaser.GameObjects.Components.Depth\n * @extends Phaser.GameObjects.Components.Mask\n * @extends Phaser.GameObjects.Components.Pipeline\n * @extends Phaser.GameObjects.Components.Transform\n * @extends Phaser.GameObjects.Components.Visible\n * @extends Phaser.GameObjects.Components.ScrollFactor\n *\n * @param {Phaser.Scene} scene -

plugin that belongs to the Scene-owned Input system.\n *\n * Its role is to listen for native DOM Gamepad Events and then process them.\n *\n * You do not need to create this class directly, the Input system will create an instance of it automatically.\n *\n * You can access it from within a Scene using `this.input.gamepad`.\n *\n * To listen for a gamepad being connected:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * this.input.gamepad.once('connected', function (pad) {\n *     //   'pad' is a reference to the gamepad that was just connected\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * Note that the browser may require you to press a button on a gamepad before it will allow you to access it,\n * this is for security reasons. However, it may also trust the page already, in which case you won't get the\n * 'connected' event and instead should check `GamepadPlugin.total` to see if it thinks there are any gamepads\n * already connected.\n *\n * Once you have received the connected event, or polled the gamepads and found them enabled, you can access\n * them via the built-in properties `GamepadPlugin.pad1` to `pad4`, for up to 4 game pads. With a reference\n * to the gamepads you can poll its buttons and axis sticks. See the properties and methods available on\n * the `Gamepad` class for more details.\n *\n * For more information about Gamepad support in browsers see the following resources:\n *\n *

* The Keyboard Plugin is an input plugin that belongs to the Scene-owned Input system.\n * \n * Its role is to listen for native DOM Keyboard Events and then process them.\n * \n * You do not need to create this class directly, the Input system will create an instance of it automatically.\n * \n * You can access it from within a Scene using `this.input.keyboard`. For example, you can do:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * this.input.keyboard.on('keydown', callback, context);\n * ```\n *\n * Or, to listen for a specific key:\n * \n * ```javascript\n * this.input.keyboard.on('keydown_A', callback, context);\n * ```\n *\n * You can also create Key objects, which you can then poll in your game loop:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * var spaceBar = this.input.keyboard.addKey(Phaser.Input.Keyboard.KeyCodes.SPACE);\n * ```\n *\n * _Note_: Many keyboards are unable to process certain combinations of keys due to hardware limitations known as ghosting.\n * See http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/4876-impossible-to-use-more-than-2-keyboard-input-buttons-at-the-same-time/ for more details.\n *\n * Also please be aware that certain browser extensions can disable or override Phaser keyboard handling.\n * For example the Chrome extension vimium is known to disable Phaser from using the D key, while EverNote disables the backtick key.\n * And there are others. So, please check your extensions before opening Phaser issues about keys that don't work.\n *\n * @class KeyboardPlugin\n * @extends Phaser.Events.EventEmitter\n * @memberOf Phaser.Input.Keyboard\n *

Scenes can have a `preload` method, which is always\n * called before the Scenes `create` method, allowing you to preload assets that the Scene may need.\n *\n * If you call any `this.load` methods from outside of `Scene.preload` then you need to start the Loader going\n * yourself by calling `Loader.start()`. It's only automatically started during the Scene preload.\n *\n * The Loader uses a combination of tag loading (eg. Audio elements) and XHR and provides progress and completion events.\n * Files are loaded in parallel by default. The amount of concurrent connections can be controlled in your Game Configuration.\n *\n * Once the Loader has started loading you are still able to add files to it. These can be injected as a result of a loader\n * event, the type of file being loaded (such as a pack file) or other external events. As long as the Loader hasn't finished\n * simply adding a new file to it, while running, will ensure it's added into the current queue.\n *\n * Every Scene has its own instance of the Loader and they are bound to the Scene in which they are created. However,\n * assets loaded by the Loader are placed into global game-level caches. For example, loading an XML file will place that\n * file inside `Game.cache.xml`, which is accessible from every Scene in your game, no matter who was responsible\n * for loading it. The same is true of Textures. A texture loaded in one Scene is instantly available to all other Scenes\n * in your game.\n *\n * The Loader works by using custom File Types. These are stored in the FileTypesManager, which injects them into the Loader\n * when it's instantiated. You can create your own custom file types by extending either the File or MultiFile classes.\n * See those files for more details.\n *\n * @class LoaderPlugin\n * @extends Phaser.Events.EventEmitter\n * @memberOf Phaser.Loader\n * @constructor\n * @since 3.0.0\n *\n * @param {Phaser.Scene} scene - The Scene which owns this Loader instance.\n */\nvar LoaderPlugin = new Class({\n\n    Extends: EventEmitter,\n\n    initialize:\n\n    function LoaderPlugin (scene)\n    {\n        EventEmitter.call(this);\n\n        var gameConfig = scene.sys.game.config;\n        var sceneConfig = scene.sys.settings.loader;\n\n        /**\n         * The Scene which owns this Loader instance.\n         *\n         * @name Phaser.Loader.LoaderPlugin#scene\n         * @type {Phaser.Scene}\n         * @protected\n         * @since 3.0.0\n         */\n        this.scene = scene;\n\n        /**\n         * A reference to the Scene Systems.\n         *\n         * @name Phaser.Loader.LoaderPlugin#systems\n         * @type {Phaser.Scenes.Systems}\n         * @protected\n         * @since 3.0.0\n         */\n        this.systems = scene.sys;\n\n        /**\n         * A reference to the global Cache Manager.\n         *\n         * @name Phaser.Loader.LoaderPlugin#cacheManager\n         * @type {Phaser.Cache.CacheManager}\n         * @protected\n         * @since 3.7.0\n         */\n        this.cacheManager = scene.sys.cache;\n\n        /**\n         * A reference to the global Texture Manager.\n         *\n         * @name Phaser.Loader.LoaderPlugin#textureManager\n         * @type {Phaser.Textures.TextureManager}\n         * @protected\n         * @since 3.7.0\n         */\n        this.textureManager = scene.sys.textures;\n\n        //  Inject the available filetypes into the Loader\n        FileTypesManager.install(this);\n\n        /**\n         * An optional prefix that is automatically prepended to the start of every file key.\n         * If prefix was `MENU.` and you load an image with the key 'Background' the resulting key would be `MENU.Background`.\n         * You can set this directly, or call `Loader.setPrefix()`.

It is added to a queue ready to be loaded either when the loader starts,\n * or if it's already running, when the next free load slot becomes available. This happens automatically if you\n * are calling this from within the Scene's `preload` method, or a related callback. Because the file is queued\n * it means you cannot use the file immediately after calling this method, but must wait for the file to complete.\n * The typical flow for a Phaser Scene is that you load assets in the Scene's `preload` method and then when the\n * Scene's `create` method is called you are guaranteed that all of those assets are ready for use and have been\n * loaded.\n * \n * If you call this from outside of `preload` then you are responsible for starting the Loader afterwards and monitoring\n * its events to know when it's safe to use the asset. Please see the Phaser.Loader.LoaderPlugin class for more details.\n * \n * The key must be a unique String. It is used to add the file to the global JSON Cache upon a successful load.\n * The key should be unique both in terms of files being loaded and files already present in the JSON Cache.\n * Loading a file using a key that is already taken will result in a warning. If you wish to replace an existing file\n * then remove it from the JSON Cache first, before loading a new one.\n *\n * Instead of passing arguments you can pass a configuration object, such as:\n * \n * ```javascript\n * this.load.animation({\n *     key: 'baddieAnims',\n *     url: 'files/BaddieAnims.json'\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * See the documentation for `Phaser.Loader.FileTypes.JSONFileConfig` for more details.\n *\n * Once the file has finished loading it will automatically be passed to the global Animation Managers `fromJSON` method.\n * This will parse all of the JSON data and create animation data from it. This process happens at the very end\n * of the Loader, once every other file in the load queue has finished. The reason for this is to allow you to load\n * both animation data and the images it relies upon in the same load call.\n *\n * Once the animation data has been parsed you will be able to play animations using that data.\n * Please see the Animation Manager `fromJSON` method for more details about the format and playback.\n * \n * You can also access the raw animation data from its Cache using its key:\n * \n * ```javascript\n * this.load.animation('baddieAnims', 'files/BaddieAnims.json');\n * // and later in your game ...\n * var data = this.cache.json.get('baddieAnims');\n * ```\n *\n * If you have specified a prefix in the loader, via `Loader.setPrefix` then this value will be prepended to this files\n * key. For example, if the prefix was `LEVEL1.` and the key was `Waves` the final key will be `LEVEL1.Waves` and\n * this is what you would use to retrieve the text from the JSON Cache.\n *\n * The URL can be relative or absolute. If the URL is relative the `Loader.baseURL` and `Loader.path` values will be prepended to it.\n *\n * If the URL isn't specified the Loader will take the key and create a filename from that. For example if the key is \"data\"\n * and no URL is given then the Loader will set the URL to be \"data.json\". It will always add `.json` as the extension, although\n * this can be overridden if using an object instead of method arguments. If you do not desire this action then provide a URL.\n *\n * You can also optionally provide a `dataKey` to use. This allows you to extract only a part of the JSON and store it in the Cache,\n * rather than the whole file. For example, if your JSON data had a structure like this:\n * \n * ```json\n * {\n *     \"level1\": {\n *         \"baddies\": {\n *             \"aliens\": {},\n *             \"boss\": {}\n *         }\n *     },\n *     \"level2\": {},\n *     \"level3\": {}\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * And if you only wanted to create animations from the `boss` data, then you could pass `level1.baddies.boss`as the `dataKey`.\n *\n * Note: The ability to load this type of file will only be available if the JSON File type has been built into Phaser.\n * It is available in the default build but can be excluded from custom builds.\n *\n * @method Phaser.Loader.LoaderPlugin#animation\n * @fires Phaser.Loader.LoaderPlugin#addFileEvent\n * @since 3.0.0\n *\n * @param {(string|Phaser.Loader.FileTypes.JSONFileConfig|Phaser.Loader.FileTypes.JSONFileConfig[])} key - The key to use for this file, or a file configuration object, or array of them.\n * @param {string} [url] - The absolute or relative URL to load this file from.

It is added to a queue ready to be loaded either when the loader starts,\n * or if it's already running, when the next free load slot becomes available. This happens automatically if you\n * are calling this from within the Scene's `preload` method, or a related callback. Because the file is queued\n * it means you cannot use the file immediately after calling this method, but must wait for the file to complete.\n * The typical flow for a Phaser Scene is that you load assets in the Scene's `preload` method and then when the\n * Scene's `create` method is called you are guaranteed that all of those assets are ready for use and have been\n * loaded.\n * \n * Phaser can load all common image types: png, jpg, gif and any other format the browser can natively handle.\n * If you try to load an animated gif only the first frame will be rendered. Browsers do not natively support playback\n * of animated gifs to Canvas elements.\n *\n * The key must be a unique String. It is used to add the file to the global Texture Manager upon a successful load.\n * The key should be unique both in terms of files being loaded and files already present in the Texture Manager.\n * Loading a file using a key that is already taken will result in a warning. If you wish to replace an existing file\n * then remove it from the Texture Manager first, before loading a new one.\n *\n * Instead of passing arguments you can pass a configuration object, such as:\n * \n * ```javascript\n * this.load.image({\n *     key: 'logo',\n *     url: 'images/AtariLogo.png'\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * See the documentation for `Phaser.Loader.FileTypes.ImageFileConfig` for more details.\n *\n * Once the file has finished loading you can use it as a texture for a Game Object by referencing its key:\n * \n * ```javascript\n * this.load.image('logo', 'images/AtariLogo.png');\n * // and later in your game ...\n * this.add.image(x, y, 'logo');\n * ```\n *\n * If you have specified a prefix in the loader, via `Loader.setPrefix` then this value will be prepended to this files\n * key. For example, if the prefix was `MENU.` and the key was `Background` the final key will be `MENU.Background` and\n * this is what you would use to retrieve the image from the Texture Manager.\n *\n * The URL can be relative or absolute. If the URL is relative the `Loader.baseURL` and `Loader.path` values will be prepended to it.\n *\n * If the URL isn't specified the Loader will take the key and create a filename from that. For example if the key is \"alien\"\n * and no URL is given then the Loader will set the URL to be \"alien.png\". It will always add `.png` as the extension, although\n * this can be overridden if using an object instead of method arguments. If you do not desire this action then provide a URL.\n *\n * Phaser also supports the automatic loading of associated normal maps. If you have a normal map to go with this image,\n * then you can specify it by providing an array as the `url` where the second element is the normal map:\n * \n * ```javascript\n * this.load.image('logo', [ 'images/AtariLogo.png', 'images/AtariLogo-n.png' ]);\n * ```\n *\n * Or, if you are using a config object use the `normalMap` property:\n * \n * ```javascript\n * this.load.image({\n *     key: 'logo',\n *     url: 'images/AtariLogo.png',\n *     normalMap: 'images/AtariLogo-n.png'\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * The normal map file is subject to the same conditions as the image file with regard to the path, baseURL, CORs and XHR Settings.\n * Normal maps are a WebGL only feature.\n *\n * Note: The ability to load this type of file will only be available if the Image File type has been built into Phaser.\n * It is available in the default build but can be excluded from custom builds.\n *\n * @method Phaser.Loader.LoaderPlugin#image\n * @fires Phaser.Loader.LoaderPlugin#addFileEvent\n * @since 3.0.0\n *\n * @param {(string|Phaser.Loader.FileTypes.ImageFileConfig|Phaser.Loader.FileTypes.ImageFileConfig[])} key - The key to use for this file, or a file configuration object, or array of them.\n * @param {string|string[]} [url] - The absolute or relative URL to load this file from.

Where every frame in the sheet is the exact same size,\n * and you reference those frames using numbers, not frame names. This is not the same thing as a Texture Atlas, where\n * the frames are packed in a way where they take up the least amount of space, and are referenced by their names,\n * not numbers. Some articles and software use the term 'Sprite Sheet' to mean Texture Atlas, so please be aware of\n * what sort of file you're actually trying to load.\n *\n * You can call this method from within your Scene's `preload`, along with any other files you wish to load:\n * \n * ```javascript\n * function preload ()\n * {\n *     this.load.spritesheet('bot', 'images/robot.png', { frameWidth: 32, frameHeight: 38 });\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * The file is **not** loaded right away.

Browsers do not natively support playback\n * of animated gifs to Canvas elements.\n *\n * The key must be a unique String. It is used to add the file to the global Texture Manager upon a successful load.\n * The key should be unique both in terms of files being loaded and files already present in the Texture Manager.\n * Loading a file using a key that is already taken will result in a warning. If you wish to replace an existing file\n * then remove it from the Texture Manager first, before loading a new one.\n *\n * Instead of passing arguments you can pass a configuration object, such as:\n * \n * ```javascript\n * this.load.spritesheet({\n *     key: 'bot',\n *     url: 'images/robot.png',\n *     frameConfig: {\n *         frameWidth: 32,\n *         frameHeight: 38,\n *         startFrame: 0,\n *         endFrame: 8\n *     }\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * See the documentation for `Phaser.Loader.FileTypes.SpriteSheetFileConfig` for more details.\n *\n * Once the file has finished loading you can use it as a texture for a Game Object by referencing its key:\n * \n * ```javascript\n * this.load.spritesheet('bot', 'images/robot.png', { frameWidth: 32, frameHeight: 38 });\n * // and later in your game ...\n * this.add.image(x, y, 'bot', 0);\n * ```\n *\n * If you have specified a prefix in the loader, via `Loader.setPrefix` then this value will be prepended to this files\n * key. For example, if the prefix was `PLAYER.` and the key was `Running` the final key will be `PLAYER.Running` and\n * this is what you would use to retrieve the image from the Texture Manager.\n *\n * The URL can be relative or absolute. If the URL is relative the `Loader.baseURL` and `Loader.path` values will be prepended to it.\n *\n * If the URL isn't specified the Loader will take the key and create a filename from that. For example if the key is \"alien\"\n * and no URL is given then the Loader will set the URL to be \"alien.png\".

Core internal plugins automatically register themselves \n * with the Cache, but it's the Plugin Manager that is responsible for injecting them into the Scenes.\n *\n * There are two types of plugin:\n *\n * 1) A Global Plugin\n * 2) A Scene Plugin\n *\n * A Global Plugin is a plugin that lives within the Plugin Manager rather than a Scene. You can get\n * access to it by calling `PluginManager.get` and providing a key. Any Scene that requests a plugin in\n * this way will all get access to the same plugin instance, allowing you to use a single plugin across\n * multiple Scenes.\n *\n * A Scene Plugin is a plugin dedicated to running within a Scene. These are different to Global Plugins\n * in that their instances do not live within the Plugin Manager, but within the Scene Systems class instead.\n * And that every Scene created is given its own unique instance of a Scene Plugin. Examples of core Scene\n * Plugins include the Input Plugin, the Tween Plugin and the physics Plugins.\n *\n * You can add a plugin to Phaser in three different ways:\n *\n * 1) Preload it\n * 2) Include it in your source code and install it via the Game Config\n * 3) Include it in your source code and install it within a Scene\n *\n * For examples of all of these approaches please see the Phaser 3 Examples Repo `plugins` folder.\n *\n * For information on creating your own plugin please see the Phaser 3 Plugin Template.\n *\n * @class PluginManager\n * @memberOf Phaser.Plugins\n * @constructor\n * @since 3.0.0\n *\n * @param {Phaser.Game} game - The game instance that owns this Plugin Manager.\n */\nvar PluginManager = new Class({\n\n    Extends: EventEmitter,\n\n    initialize:\n\n    function PluginManager (game)\n    {\n        EventEmitter.call(this);\n\n        /**\n         * The game instance that owns this Plugin Manager.\n         *\n         * @name Phaser.Plugins.PluginManager#game\n         * @type {Phaser.Game}\n         * @since 3.0.0\n         */\n        this.game = game;\n\n        /**\n         * The global plugins currently running and managed by this Plugin Manager.\n         * A plugin must have been started at least once in order to appear in this list.\n         *\n         * @name Phaser.Plugins.PluginManager#plugins\n         * @type {GlobalPlugin[]}\n         * @since 3.8.0\n         */\n        this.plugins = [];\n\n        /**\n         * A list of plugin keys that should be installed into Scenes as well as the Core Plugins.\n         *\n         * @name Phaser.Plugins.PluginManager#scenePlugins\n         * @type {string[]}\n         * @since 3.8.0\n         */\n        this.scenePlugins = [];\n\n        /**\n         * A temporary list of plugins to install when the game has booted.\n         *\n         * @name Phaser.Plugins.PluginManager#_pendingGlobal\n         * @private\n         * @type {array}\n         * @since 3.8.0\n         */\n        this._pendingGlobal = [];\n\n        /**\n         * A temporary list of scene plugins to install when the game has booted.\n         *\n         * @name Phaser.Plugins.PluginManager#_pendingScene\n         * @private\n         * @type {array}\n         * @since 3.8.0\n         */\n        this._pendingScene = [];\n\n        if (game.isBooted)\n        {\n            this.boot();\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            game.events.once('boot', this.boot, this);\n        }\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * Run once the game has booted and installs all of the plugins configured in the Game Config.\n     *\n     * @method Phaser.Plugins.PluginManager#boot\n     * @protected\n     * @since 3.0.0\n     */\n    boot: function ()\n    {\n        var i;\n        var entry;\n        var key;\n        var plugin;\n        var start;\n        var mapping;\n        var config = this.game.config;\n\n        //  Any plugins to install?\n        var list = config.installGlobalPlugins;\n\n        //  Any plugins added outside of the game config, but before the game booted?\n        list = list.concat(this._pendingGlobal);\n\n        for (i = 0; i < list.length; i++)\n        {\n            entry = list[i];\n\n            // { key: 'TestPlugin', plugin: TestPlugin, start: true, mapping: 'test' }\n\n            key = GetFastValue(entry, 'key', null);\n            plugin = GetFastValue(entry, 'plugin', null);\n            start = GetFastValue(entry, 'start', false);\n            mapping = GetFastValue(entry, 'mapping', null);\n\n            if (key && plugin)\n            {\n                this.install(key, plugin, start, mapping);\n            }\n        }\n\n        //  Any scene plugins to install?\n        list = config.installScenePlugins;\n\n        //  Any plugins added outside of the game config, but before the game booted?\n        list = list.concat(this._pendingScene);\n\n        for (i = 0; i < list.length; i++)\n        {\n            entry = list[i];\n\n            // { key: 'moveSpritePlugin', plugin: MoveSpritePlugin, , mapping: 'move' }\n\n            key = GetFastValue(entry, 'key', null);\n            plugin = GetFastValue(entry, 'plugin', null);\n            mapping = GetFastValue(entry, 'mapping', null);\n\n            if (key && plugin)\n            {\n                this.installScenePlugin(key, plugin, mapping);\n            }\n        }\n\n        this._pendingGlobal = [];\n        this._pendingScene = [];\n\n        this.game.events.once('destroy', this.destroy, this);\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * Called by the Scene Systems class.

The default value is GL_TRIANGLES.\n *              Here is the full list of rendering primitives (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Constants).\n * - vertShader: Source for vertex shader as a string.\n * - fragShader: Source for fragment shader as a string.\n * - vertexCapacity: The amount of vertices that shall be allocated\n * - vertexSize: The size of a single vertex in bytes.\n * - vertices: An optional buffer of vertices\n * - attributes: An array describing the vertex attributes\n *  \n * The vertex attributes properties are:\n * - name : String - Name of the attribute in the vertex shader\n * - size : integer - How many components describe the attribute. For ex: vec3 = size of 3, float = size of 1\n * - type : GLenum - WebGL type (gl.BYTE, gl.SHORT, gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE, gl.UNSIGNED_SHORT, gl.FLOAT)\n * - normalized : boolean - Is the attribute normalized\n * - offset : integer - The offset in bytes to the current attribute in the vertex.
